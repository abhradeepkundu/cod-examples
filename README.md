# Cloudera Operational Database Examples

This repository is a collection of examples which demonstrate self-contained applications
running against the Cloudera Operational Database (COD) Experience.

These are "getting started" examples which are designed to be standalone and demonstrate
the developer's path. It is expected that, for each example, you will modify some part
of it to connect the application to your COD database.
