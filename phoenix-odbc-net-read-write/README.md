# Phoenix ODBC .NET Client

This example demonstrates how to create a Phoenix ODBC client with ADO.NET extensions in .NET
Framework 4.5.2 and above.

It uses the standard DSN-less connection string approach to connect to PhoenixDB and to get it 
working you need to set the following parameters in the connection string based on your 
environment's connectivity info:

- `hostname` : The Phoenix ODBC endpoint hostname without any prefix (http://) or port number,
- `http_path` : The HTTP path after the hostname,
- `username` : Workload username to login,
- `encryptedPwd` : The encrypted password,
- `tableName` : Name of the PhoenixDB table (BUBU in our example).

The program will add some records to the table at the beginning and retrieves them after that.
Schema of the table is very simple, consists of a single int-type private key.
